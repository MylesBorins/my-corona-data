This folder contains files with data that focus on the most recent period of the outbreak. It includes daily 7-day cumulative percent positivity for the molecular test by modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (MODZCTA), and trend data that cover the most recent 90 days.

## Files 

### last7days-by-modzcta.csv

This file contains person-level information on molecular testing: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the median rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by MODZCTA. Please see the technical notes for a description of MODZCTA ([Geography: Zip codes and ZCTAs](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas)), the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing), and details on the [calculation of percent positivity](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#calculation-of-percent-positivity). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test). Please note that the number of people with positive results does not include people who previously tested positive.

Indicators, which are calculated for the most recent 7-days, include:

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe  | 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------| 
| MODZCTA | MODZCTA | |          
| MODZCTA_NAME | Neighborhood name of the MODZCTA | |    
| PERCENTPOSITIVITY_7DAY | Percentage of people with a molecular test who tested positive by MODZCTA | Cumulative across current day and 6 previous days |
| PEOPLE_TESTED | Number of people who received a molecular test by MODZCTA | Cumulative across current day and 6 previous days | 
| PEOPLE_POSITIVE | Number of people with a positive result on a molecular test by MODZCTA | Cumulative across current day and 6 previous days | 
| MEDIAN_DAILY_TEST_RATE | Median rate of molecular testing per 100,000 people by MODZCTA | Median across current day and 6 previous days | 
| ADEQUATELY_TESTED | Indicator used by NYC to identify MODZCTA where the MEDIAN_DAILY_TEST_RATE exceeds 260 per 100,000 people | | 
| DATERANGE | Range of dates included in the most recent 7 days | | 

Neighborhood names represent the [Neighborhood Organizing Census Committee](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/census/index.page) boundaries, which were recently developed by the U.S. Census Bureau with input from community groups

Note that sum of counts in this file may not match values in citywide tables because of records with missing geographic information.

### now-covid-like-illness.csv 

This file contains the same data as covid-like-illness.csv, but limited to the most recent 90 days. For details, please visit [Trends/Readme/covid-like-illness.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/Readme.md#covid-like-illnesscsv) 

### now-data-by-day.csv 

This file contains the same data as data-by-day.csv, but limited to the most recent 90 days. For details, please visit [Trends/Readme/data-by-day.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/tree/master/trends#data-by-daycsv) 

### now-deaths-by-day.csv 

This file contains the same data as deaths-by-day.csv, but limited to the most recent 90 days. For details, please visit [Trends/Readme/deaths-by-day.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/tree/master/trends#deaths-by-day)

### now-summary.csv   

This file contains summary information, including the cut-off date and time for data included in the most recent update, and several citywide indicators.     

Indicators include: 

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe | 
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| MEASURE | Indicator of interest | |         
| LAST_7_DAY | Percent positivity for the molecular test and counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the last 7 days | Most recent day and previous 6 days |   
| WEEKLY_AVG_LAST_4_WKS | Weekly average of percent positivity for the molecular test and counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the last 28 days | Average across most recent day and previous 27 days | 
| TOTAL | Cumulative counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths | Cumulative |   

Hospitalization counts reflect the total number of people with COVID-19 ever admitted to a hospital, not the number of people currently admitted. Death counts reflect confirmed classifications, and case counts reflect both confirmed and probable classifications, separately. 

### now-testing-by-age.csv 

This file contains the same data as testing-by-age.csv, but limited to the most recent 90 days. For details, please visit [Trends/Readme/testing-by-age.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/Readme.md#testing-by-agecsv) 

### now-tests.csv 

This file contains the same data as tests.csv, but limited to the most recent 90 days. For details, please visit [Trends/Readme/tests.csv](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/Readme.md#testscsv) 

### pp-by-modzcta.csv 

This file contains person-level information on molecular testing: the percentage of people tested who tested positive in the 7 days preceding the indicated “end date,” stratified by day and by three different geographies: citywide, borough, MODZCTA. The level of geography is indicated in each column heading.

Please see the technical notes for a description of MODZCTA ([Geography: Zip codes and ZCTAs](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas)), the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing), and details on the [calculation of percent positivity](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#calculation-of-percent-positivity). The data shown in this table are displayed by the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test) for a molecular test.

Unlike other data in this repository, this file excludes patients in congregate facilities, and people who previously tested positive, to better track community transmission.
