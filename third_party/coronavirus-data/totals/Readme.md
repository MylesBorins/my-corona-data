# totals/ 

This folder contains cumulative totals since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC, which the Health Department defines as the diagnosis of the first laboratory-confirmed case on February 29, 2020. Note that the Health Department recommends against interpreting daily changes to these files as one day’s worth of data, due to the difference between date of event and date of report.

| Variable name | Definition | Timeframe | 
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| RACE_GROUP | Race/ethnicity group | |        
| CASE_RATE_ADJ | Age-adjusted rate of confirmed cases per 100,000 people by race/ethnicity group | Cumulative |

Data on people identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races, or other races/ethnicities are not included in this table. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Race/ethnicity information is most complete for people who have been hospitalized or have died. There are much less data currently available on race/ethnicity for people who have not been hospitalized.    

Note that sum of counts in this file may not match citywide values because of records with missing demographic information. This file does not contain information on probable deaths.     

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term institutional and personal biases against people of color. There is no evidence that these health inequities are due to personal traits. Lasting racism and an inequitable distribution of resources needed for wellness cause these health inequities. These resources include quality jobs, housing, health care and food, among others. The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.
