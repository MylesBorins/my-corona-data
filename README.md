#  My Corona Data

This is a small local dashboard I've been using to track coronavirus + COVID-19
statistics in NYC and Toronto, the two cities I call home.

## Where is the data from?

This repo vendors both state and city data for NYC.

For Toronto data I am using the published Toronto data, and am manually collecting data
for the @TOPublicHealth on twitter.

Data sources are updated regularly.
